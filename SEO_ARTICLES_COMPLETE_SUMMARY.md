**LinkedIn** (B2B focus):
```
Most businesses still use radius buffers for delivery zones.

Big mistake.

A 10-mile radius doesn't account for:
- Traffic patterns
- Road networks
- Real travel times

That's why leading logistics companies use isochrone mapping.

Our comprehensive guide shows how: [link]

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Code Example Testing

All code examples should be:
1. **Tested**: Run and verified before publishing
2. **Complete**: No pseudo-code (unless explicitly labeled)
3. **Documented**: Comments explaining each section
4. **Accessible**: Use common libraries, avoid obscure dependencies

### API Example Standards

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Complete, runnable example
async function fetchIsochrone() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.isomap.io/v1/isochrone', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      origin: { lat: 37.7749, lon: -122.4194 },
      mode: 'driving',
      intervals: [1800]  // 30 minutes
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
  return data;
}

// Call the function
fetchIsochrone();
```

```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Incomplete, pseudo-code
function getIsochrone() {
  // Call API
  // Return results
}
```

### Image Requirements

Each article should include:
1. **Hero image**: 1200x630px (social sharing)
2. **Diagram images**: At least 3-5 visual explanations
3. **Code output screenshots**: Show what the code produces
4. **Map examples**: Actual visualizations

**Alt text format**:
```
Alt: "Isochrone map showing 15, 30, and 45-minute drive time zones from San Francisco warehouse location with delivery van routes"
```
