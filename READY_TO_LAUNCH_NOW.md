- Has working demo to prove it

**Option 2:**
```
Show HN: IsoMap – Drive-time mapping API, 50% cheaper than Mapbox
```
- Direct value prop

- Shows price advantage

**Option 3:**
```
Show HN: Interactive isochrone API demo (OpenStreetMap + OSRM)
```
- Technical focus
- Open source angle
- Appeals to HN crowd

### URL:
```
https://isomap.io
```

### Post Text (Optional):
```
Hi HN! I'm building an isochrone (drive-time mapping) API.

I was building a field service app and realized Mapbox isochrone
API costs $4/1K requests ($400/mo for 100K). TravelTime and
Targomo require sales calls.

So I'm building a developer-first alternative: $199/mo for 100K
requests, transparent pricing, no sales calls.

BUT - I'm validating demand first. I built this demo to prove
the concept works. If I get 5+ signups with strong use cases,
I'll build the production API. If not, I pivot.

Try the interactive demo on the page - you can generate real
isochrones for any city, any travel mode.

Would love your feedback!
```

### When to Post:
**Best times for HN:**
- Monday-Thursday: 8-10 AM EST or 2-4 PM EST
- Avoid Friday afternoon/weekend

## 🎯 WHAT TO EXPECT ON HN

### Best Case (50-100+ upvotes):
- Front page for 4-8 hours
- 500-1000 visitors
- 10-20 signups
- Constructive feedback
- Some technical questions

### Realistic Case (10-30 upvotes):
- 100-300 visitors
- 3-7 signups
- Mix of positive and critical comments
- Good validation data

### Common Criticisms (Be Ready):
1. **"This is just OpenRouteService wrapped"**
   - Response: "Demo uses ORS API. Production will use optimized OSRM infrastructure with better performance and pricing."

2. **"You haven't built anything yet"**
   - Response: "Correct - I'm validating demand before investing 6 weeks. Demo proves the concept works. If I get strong signals, I build it."

3. **"Why not just use Mapbox?"**
   - Response: "Mapbox costs $4/1K requests. For 100K/mo that's $400. My target is $199 with similar quality. Different segment."

4. **"Pricing is made up"**
   - Response: "Fair point. Based on estimated infra costs: OSRM hosting (~$50/mo), CDN (~$30/mo), overhead (~$20/mo) = ~$100 cost, 50% margin. Will adjust based on actual costs."

5. **"Security: API key visible in code"**
   - Response: "Demo key with rate limits. Production will use proper auth. Good catch!"

### How to Respond:
- Be honest
- Be humble
- Ask for feedback
- Don't be defensive
- Thank people for criticism

## 📱 SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

### Twitter/X:
```
Just launched IsoMap.io – an isochrone mapping API 🗺️

✅ Interactive demo (try it yourself!)
✅ 50% cheaper than Mapbox
✅ Drive, walk, bike modes
✅ No sales calls

Validating demand before building. If you'd use this,
join the waitlist!

### LinkedIn:
```
Excited to share IsoMap.io - an isochrone (drive-time)
mapping API I'm building 🗺️

Background: While building a field service app, I realized
existing solutions are either too expensive (Mapbox: $400/mo)
or require sales calls (TravelTime, Targomo).

So I built a demo to validate demand before investing weeks
of dev time. The interactive demo lets you generate real
isochrones for any city.

Goal: Get 5 signups with strong use cases → build production API

Check it out and let me know what you think!

### Reddit (r/webdev, r/SaaS, r/entrepreneur):
```
Title: Launched an isochrone mapping API demo - feedback welcome!

I built IsoMap.io to solve a problem I kept running into:
existing isochrone APIs are either expensive (Mapbox: $4/1K
requests) or require sales calls.

Before investing weeks building the full API, I created an
interactive demo to validate demand. You can try generating
real isochrones for any city, any travel mode (drive/walk/bike).

My validation strategy: If I get 5+ signups with strong use
cases, I'll build the production API in 6 weeks. If not, I pivot.

Would love your feedback on:
- Pricing ($199/mo for 100K requests - fair?)
- Use cases (what would you build with this?)
- Demo (anything missing?)

Thanks!

## 📧 FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TEMPLATE

When someone signs up, email within 24 hours:

```
Subject: Quick question about IsoMap

Hi [Name],

Thanks for joining the IsoMap waitlist!

Quick question: What would you use an isochrone API for?

I'm trying to understand the most important use cases to
build the right product.

Curious:
- What do you use today for drive-time mapping?
- What frustrates you about current solutions?
- What price point makes sense for your use case?

I'm validating demand before building. If I get 5+ signups
with strong use cases, I'll build the production API. Your
feedback helps me decide if this is worth building.

Thanks!

[Your name]
hello@isomap.io
