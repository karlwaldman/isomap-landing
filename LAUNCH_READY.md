## 📈 WHAT TO MONITOR

### Traffic (Vercel Analytics):
- Go to: https://vercel.com/karl-waldmans-projects/isomap-landing/analytics
- Check daily visitors
- Track conversion rate (visitors → signups)

### Signups (Google Form):
- Check responses daily
- Set up email notifications for new responses
- Track source of signups (HN, Reddit, etc.)

### Engagement:
- HN upvotes and comments
- Reddit karma and discussion

- Email responses

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### 1. Don't Build Yet
Validate demand with 5 emails FIRST.
Don't code the API until you have paying customers lined up.

### 2. Email Signups Immediately
Reply within 24 hours.
Personal email, specific question.
Track every response.

### 3. Make Data-Driven Decision
After 2 weeks, look at the data:
- If strong signals → Build MVP
- If weak signals → Pivot or kill

### 4. This is a Lifestyle Business
Not a unicorn. Target is $50-100K ARR.
Perfect for solo founder.
Don't need VC, don't need huge team.
